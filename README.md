# Q-learning -> Graduation Project

   This project was realized with C++ language and wxWidget library. In the project, a virtual robot with the shortest path was created with the Q Learning Algorithm. Now it's very easy for the robot to learn by itself by trying all the ways by showing the robot thumbnail from the user generated user page.This programming of the robot has always made several observations of the shortest paths.
